# Shopping web-app on React

Test task from Scandiweb

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tech requirement 

Available under the link: https://www.notion.so/Entry-React-developer-TEST-39f601f8aa3f48ac88c4a8fefda304c1.

In this project, just one request was intentionally omitted: class components. I prefer to use more modern way to code in React, React Router, Redux by using hooks and functional components 

## Features

- Fetch data from endpoint [https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint] and display it on UI (performed within API) due to the provided design (https://www.figma.com/file/MSyCAqVy1UgNap0pvqH6H3/Junior-Frontend-Test-Designs-Public?node-id=0%3A1)
- Sort products by category
- Cart overlay and currency dropdown close on click outside the element. Not just on click on the icon.
- Add products to the cart via floating button on product list page or directly in product description page
- Switching currency in dropdown (navbar)
